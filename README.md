# 3 Card Spread

This program will provide three cards. You can invent your own prompts or borrow from these common spreads.

## Past-Present-Future Tarot Spreads
In the past, present, future tarot spread, the first card pulled represents elements from the past affecting present events.

The second card shows the nature of the tarot question or the querent’s current position.

The third card represents the likely outcome. Meditating on the past and the present cards can show you how the future card fits in.

## Situation-Obstacle-Advice/Outcome Tarot Spreads
This spread is especially useful to help understand a conflict or resolve the tension. The first card pulled for the situation often represents the querent’s role.

Then, the obstacle card in this tarot spread crosses the first card to show what elements are causing the conflict or tension.

The final card can be flexible. Perhaps it reveals a likely outcome, or it can offer advice for the querent: how should they act to make the most of the situation?

## Mind-Body-Spirit Tarot Spreads
Mind, body, spirit tarot spreads can help a reader understand what is needed to add balance to a querent’s life.

For this reason, consider using it for general lessons or impressions. Depending on the querent’s needs, each card may represent the current state, approaching energies, or advice for alignment in each realm.
